# Where the Idea Came From

Some time ago, a live-streaming website introduced a category called *Pools, Hot Tubs & Beaches*, where people would stream from a hot tub, often engaging in activities that seemed to violate the platform’s content guidelines—but they weren’t banned. Meanwhile, small art creators were getting banned for the slightest mistake.

Our friend on Discord was outraged by this and constantly voiced his frustration. Since I enjoy making small games with *Game Jam*-like constraints, I decided, along with the Discord community, to create a lighthearted and humorous game inspired by this situation.

This experience was particularly interesting because, for the first time, I was able to encourage people—who were still figuring out their career paths at the time—to explore their future ambitions. They got to try their hands at game-related roles like illustration, writing, quality assurance, and voice acting.
